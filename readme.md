# Jeevan Jacob's Project Showcase

Welcome to my GitHub repository of personal and academic projects. This space serves as a portfolio to showcase my work in **Python**

I’m currently pursuing my **B.Tech in Computer Science and Engineering** at Jyothi Engineering College, and I'm passionate about building real-world solutions through code.

# About This Repository

This repository will contain individual subfolders for each project I'm going to create. Each folder includes a working solution with its own `README.md`, source code, and any relevant files or documentation.

I'm uploading **one project every day** as part of my commitment to consistency and skill development.
